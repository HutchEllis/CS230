Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room was a company that wanted to expand their Android application into a web-based game

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
One thing I would say I did particularly well is that I analyzed all of the requirements and took the design constraints into consideration when looking at the different options they had when it came to operating systems.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I think that working through a design document is sort of like a blueprint. It gives you all of what needs to be done and what obstacles you may run into and it is your job to figure out how to make ends meet.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise my evaluation. There is so much more information I could have provided but I was limited by the table size.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
User's needs are always important to consider when designing a program. You want to ensure that the user has a pleasurable experience because that what will lead to user retention.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Before approaching the software design, I first finished up the software design template, which as I mentioned earlier kind of serves as a blueprint for the actual code and can make it much easier when it comes time to code because you already have an idea of what needs to be done and what constraints you may have.
